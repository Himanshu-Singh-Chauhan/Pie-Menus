###### there is still a lot to do in pie menus, go easy on it, and keep an eye on updates. üòâ

# What is Pie Menus

Blender like pie menus for windows, (blender is free 3d software), its not limited or confined to app, you can set up pie menus for any app or window on your system. 

Pie Menus allow you to improve your workflow, you can use it to launch applications, simulate long hotkeys, open URLs, open favourite file folder locations, run other python scripts which automates repetitive tasks and navigate browsers, explorers and windows much faster. It‚Äôs very powerful tool once mastered, which is fairly easy. It also has submenus, which is like another pie menu inside a pie menu, you also bind different task on scroll wheel for menu, like volume or brightness control.

Pie Menus are somewhat like context menu, but instead of showing a menu with options in a listed manner, pie menus shows the option in a circle around the mouse cursor. In case you don't know what context menu are, the menu that pop up when you right click on desktop, or on a file, or on some selected text is called context menu. You can check out some screenshots below as to how pie menus look like.

**Note**: Pie menus are designed to be used in with combination of keyboard and mouse (**not trackpad**), although with the use trigger keys (a feature in pie menus) you can eliminate the use of mouse in some cases, which is still efficient but definitely not the best. Triggers keys are there for times when you don't have your any hand on mouse and don't want to take your hand off keyboard or don't want to reach the mouse at all.

**How to use Pie Menus** üñ±
---

The Pie menus will pop up when you press an assigned hotkey, once open you can select an menu/option in it using mouse. 

There are two ways to use:

- You press the hotkey normally (press and let go), the pie menus will open and stay until a menu is selected or the pie menu is cancelled using 'esc' or right click. To activate a menu, select using hovering mouse near it, and pressing left click (lifting left click will activate the selected menu).
- Pressing and holding down the hotkey, the pie menus will stay open until the held hotkey is released, when releasing the hotkey, the selected menu will automatically get activated, there is no need for left click, just hover on the menu to activate and release the hotkey. Using this mode which I like to call marking mode (from Autodesk Maya), you can speed up your workflow significantly. It will feel just like drawing gesture using mouse. After a few usage of it, you can also do it with your eyes closed as your muscle memory will remember which way to flick the mouse to activate certain menu. and yes in marking mode also pie menu can be cancelled using 'esc'  or right click. 

**Quick Getting Started** : After installing and running, go to desktop and press tilde key  `  on keyboard to call a pie menu.

**A Special Thanks** ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

A very special thanks to <a href = "https://github.com/dumbeau">Beau Gills</a> for his marvellous work <a href = "https://github.com/dumbeau/AutoHotPie">AutoHotPie</a>, He in the first place created pie menus for windows using Autohotkey scripting language, Its just awesome and mind blowing how much effort he has put into it. For days I was searching for pie menus for windows and it was the only project I found after too many google searches and it changed everything. I must admit that this project wouldn't be here *how it is* without Beau. My heartful thanks to him ‚ù§üòä.
